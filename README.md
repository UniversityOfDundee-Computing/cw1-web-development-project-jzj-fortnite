## Design Layouts and Components

- To design the webpages, we have created wireframes using Figma as a blueprint for layout and structure, ensuring a clear visual guide before the final design phase. [Wireframe-Link](https://www.figma.com/design/HVh4F2WbQbpSsUpFLs2yqI/cw1?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=Zm2Ywkcp5YC8IG9L-0)
- For color palette, we have used [Fortnite-Season-6](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/65871) color palette from Color-Hex.com.
- For font style, we have used [Fortnite-regular](https://www.fontget.com/font/fortnite/) font from fontget.com.
