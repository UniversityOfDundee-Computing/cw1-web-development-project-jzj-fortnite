                    >
                    at Epic Games following the publishing of

                    around 2011. Though it was not initially one of the
                    developed titles during the jam, the concept of merging the

                    >, and shooter games arose, leading to the foundation of
                    <em>Fortnite</em>. Development of <em>Fortnite</em> slowed
                    due to several issues, including switching from the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine"
                      >Unreal Engine</a

                    approach to extend the life of the game, and a switch of art
                    style from a dark theme to a more cartoonish style. Further,
                    Epic was looking to get into the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_as_a_service"
                      >games as a service</a

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent">Tencent</a>
                    took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the
                    departure of several executives, including
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Bleszinski"
                      >Cliff Bleszinski</a
                    >, who had been a key part of <em>Fortnite</em>'s
                    development. <em>Fortnite</em>'s approach was changed to be
                    Epic's testbed for games as a service, and further slowed
                    the development. Epic was able to prepare to release
                    <em>Fortnite</em> as a paid early access title in July 2017,
                    with plans to release it as free-to-play sometime in 2019
                    while gaining feedback from players to improve the game.
                    With the release of <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em>, the
                    player-versus-environment mode was distinguished as "Save
                    the World". Ultimately, Epic opted to release Save the World
                    as a premium title, bringing it out of early access on June
                    29, 2020.

                  <p>
                    Near the same time that Epic released <em>Fortnite</em> into
                    early access,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUBG:_Battlegrounds"
                      >PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a

                    had become a worldwide phenomenon, having sold over 5
                    million copies three months from its March 2017 release, and
                    drawing strong interest in the battle royale genre. Epic
                    recognized that with the <em>Fortnite</em> base game, they
                    could also do a battle royale mode, and rapidly developed
                    their own version atop <em>Fortnite</em> in about two
                    months. By September 2017, Epic was ready to release this as
                    a second mode from "Save the World" in the paid-for earlier
                    access, but then later decided to release it as a free game,
                    <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em>, supported with
                    microtransactions. This version quickly gained players, with
                    over 10 million players during its first two weeks of
                    release, and leading Epic to create separate teams to
                    continue the <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> development
                    apart from the Save the World version, outside of common
                    engine elements and art assets. This allowed
                    <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> to expand to other platforms
                    otherwise not supported by Save the World, including iOS and
                    Android mobile devices and the Nintendo Switch.

                    start of season 7 of <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em>. Each
                    player has access to a private, persistent island on which
                    they construct buildings and add and manipulate objects as

                    to the game mode for free.

                  <h3>Fortnite Experiences (2023-present)</h3>
                  <p>
                    In March 2023, Epic released the Unreal Editor for Fortnite
                    (UEFN), a standalone editor for Windows. UEFN allows
                    creators to use the Unreal Editor with features of Unreal
                    Engine 5 and <em>Fortnite</em> assets in developing new
                    modes within the <em>Fortnite Creative</em> mode; this mode
                    was called "Creative 2.0". In October 2023, Epic redesigned
                    the main <em>Fortnite</em> client to present Epic's own
                    various modes as well as the numerous creative modes as part
                    of <em>Fortnite Experiences</em>, comparable to

                    >
                    in presentation. This was followed by the introduction of
                    three new Epic-developed modes for the game in December
                    2023:

                    developed in conjunction with

                    and

                    developed by
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonix">Harmonix</a
                    >. Each mode was introduced as free-to-play, interfacing
                    with the game's battle pass system, and offering new rewards
                    associated with those modes. Numerous improvements in UEFN
                    were announced in March 2024, including the addition of
                    Unreal Engine's MetaHuman character rendering technology,
                    and more assets from Lego, Rocket Racing, and

                      >Fall Guys</a
                    >. Epic also stated their intent to have future
                    <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> seasons starting in late
                    2025 to be developed in UEFN.
